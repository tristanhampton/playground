I popped the question! And she said yes! Not that I was worried. Lindsay helped pick the ring and knew that it was somewhere in the house. And asking her to treck through the woods in the dark was a bit of a giveaway. I had gone earlier in the day with a friend to string up some battery powered lights I bought at Ikea with a staple gun. The effort was certainly worth it!
