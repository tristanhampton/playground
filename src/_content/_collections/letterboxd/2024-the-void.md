review: "I thought that the movie succeeded in being unsettling without the use of jump scares which is always a win. SPOILER I really liked the mystery behind the titular Void, but I felt the antagonists transformation at the end took away from that mystery and didn’t really fit the theme of the movie, it felt more like he had become a sci fi antagonist that was transported to a cosmic horror."
